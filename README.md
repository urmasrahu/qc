Quantum Computing related exercises according to the book:

Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists
by Noson S. Yanofsky and Mirco A. Manucci

Requires:
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
* Googletest, clone or download from https://github.com/google/googletest

Setting up the build environment:
* Clone or download Googletest into a folder named "googletest", placed at the parent of the "qc" folder.

Note: the qc project is not used for anything now, test_qc has all the stuff.
